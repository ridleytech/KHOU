My weekend exploration creating a sample React Native app for KHOU11 news.

Features:

- News feed populated by AWS backend
- Stories stored in AWS DynamoDB database table
- Backend API developed using AWS Lambda NodeJS that pulls data from AWS services
- In-app image caching
- Story video playback on story page
- Story linking to website article
- Google Admob ads integration into news feed and Story page
- Initial setup for GA4 analytics integration
