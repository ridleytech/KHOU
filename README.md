My weekend exploration creating a sample React Native app for KHOU11 news.

Features:

- News feed populated by AWS backend
- Stories stored in AWS DynamoDB database table
- Images stored in AWS S3 bucket storage
- Backend API developed using AWS Lambda NodeJS that pulls data from my AWS services
- Google Admob ads integration into news feed and Story page
- Initial setup for GA4 analytics integration
